Hospital Management System (C++ & SFML)

This project is a Hospital Management System developed in C++ using the SFML library to provide a graphical user interface (GUI). The system allows users to add patient records through interactive input boxes and store data permanently using file handling.

The application features a medical-themed green interface, clearly designed input fields for Patient ID, Name, Age, and Disease, and supports both keyboard and mouse interaction. A visible cursor highlights the active input box, making data entry easy and user-friendly. Buttons can be activated using either mouse clicks or the Enter key, ensuring accessibility and smooth user experience.

Patient records are saved in a text file, enabling persistent data storage. The project demonstrates key programming concepts such as structures, file handling, event-driven programming, and GUI development using SFML. This system is suitable for academic projects and serves as a strong example of combining C++ logic with graphical interfaces.
